# Contributing to Privasys Wallet

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This monorepo contains the Privasys Wallet mobile app, the `@privasys/auth` browser SDK, and the authentication broker.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install prerequisites:
   - [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+ (wallet & SDK)
   - [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.24+ (broker)
   - [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable (native RA-TLS module, optional for app-only changes)
3. Install dependencies:

   cd wallet && bun install
   cd ../sdk && bun install
   ```

## Project Structure

| Path | Language | Description |

## Making Changes

- Write meaningful commit messages (e.g. `wallet: add batch auth flow`).
- Use `bunx tsc --noEmit` to type-check the wallet and SDK before pushing.
- Use `go vet ./...` in the broker directory.
- Follow the existing code style in each sub-project.
